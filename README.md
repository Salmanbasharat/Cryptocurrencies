# **CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

## **Project Overview**
This project is about analysis & visualization of Cryptocurrencies data for an investment portfolio and the data is grouped to create a classification system for this portfolio using unsupervised ML model. This includes the PCA data and visualization through 3-D Scatter.
I created a table of Tradable Cyrptocurrencies (Total 685 ), scaled this data to create the scatter plot of these Tradable cryptocurrencies, made a new DataFrame and visualized this data through 'hvplot scatter'.

The code can be seen through [this link](crypto_clustering.ipynb).
